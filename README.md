# Marketor - The Vibe Marketing Platform

The Marketing skillset used by [mechabee.com/marketor/](https://mechabee.com/marketor)


## How is this used by Marketor?

This skillset is initialized into each user new workspace when creating a new one.

## Why this project?

The idea behind this project is to open the skills definition and build a community around Marketor so that open contributions can make it more robust and versatile.

## Current state

With each new release we refresh the skillset according to this project. This will seed new workspaces.

## Next Phase

MechaBee platform user settings will be extended to allow the upload of personalized skillsets per agent, so that customers can branch off and customize the behaviour of Marketor. Those settings will override system defaualt skillset still there to fall back if required.
