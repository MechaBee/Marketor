## Digital Marketing Strategy

### Part 1: The Core Strategy — The "Why" Before the "What"

Before we get to formats, let's establish our guiding principles:

1. **Focus on the Pain Point, Not the Product:** Identify the core problem your target audience faces and explain why they should care about solving it rather than focusing on product features.

2. **Educate, Don't Just Sell:** Explain how your industry/product can be confusing and position your company as the trusted expert that simplifies the process.

3. **Lead with the Lifestyle/Outcome, Not the Service:** Identify what your customers are actually excited about or searching for, and explain how to hook them with that content before pivoting to your solution.

4. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Define how to use visuals and storytelling to demonstrate value rather than just stating benefits.

5. **Consistency Across Touchpoints:** *(NEW)* Ensure brand voice, visual identity, and core messaging remain consistent across all platforms while adapting format to each channel's strengths.

6. **Test, Learn, Iterate:** *(NEW)* Every piece of content is a hypothesis. Measure performance, learn from data, and continuously refine your approach.
