# Master Calendar Manifest (Template)
# Copy this template to: /calendar/master-calendar.yaml
#
# Purpose:
# - Workspace index of all calendar files (campaigns + regular-social)
# - Used by scheduling/validation workflows to discover calendars
#
# Conventions:
# - calendar_file values are workspace-relative paths
# - For campaign calendars, campaign_id should match the folder name under /campaigns/
# - status: active | paused | completed
# - type: regular | campaign

calendar_version: "1.0"
last_updated: "[CURRENT_DATE]" # YYYY-MM-DD (update when you change this manifest)

# List of campaigns with their calendar file references (workspace-relative paths)
campaigns: []

# Example entries (uncomment and edit):
#
# - campaign_id: regular-social
#   calendar_file: regular-social/calendar.yaml
#   status: active # active | paused | completed
#   type: regular # regular | campaign
#
# - campaign_id: my-campaign
#   calendar_file: campaigns/my-campaign/calendar.yaml
