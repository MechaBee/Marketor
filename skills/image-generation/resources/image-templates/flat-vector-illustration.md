## Flat Vector Best Practices

### Color Guidelines
- **Limit palette**: 3-5 colors maximum
- **High contrast**: Ensure readability and impact
- **Consistent saturation**: Keep colors in same family
- **No gradients**: Pure flat fills only

### Shape Guidelines
- **Geometric basis**: Circles, rectangles, triangles
- **Rounded corners**: Friendly, approachable feel
- **Consistent stroke**: Same weight throughout
- **Simple silhouettes**: Instantly recognizable

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Gradients or shadows | Flat solid colors |
| Photorealistic textures | Clean geometric shapes |
| Complex details | Simplified forms |
| Multiple stroke weights | Consistent thin outlines |
| Too many colors | Limited, cohesive palette |

### Character Proportions
- **Head**: Larger than realistic (1/4 to 1/3 of body)
- **Body**: Simplified torso, minimal detail
- **Limbs**: Simple shapes, often without joints
- **Hands**: Mitten-style or simple shapes
- **Feet**: Small, rounded forms
