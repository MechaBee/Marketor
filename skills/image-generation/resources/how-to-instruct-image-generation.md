## Core Principles

### The Foundation Formula
Every effective image generation prompt should contain three essential elements:
- **Subject**: The main focus or primary object
- **Context**: The environment, setting, or background
- **Style**: The artistic or photographic approach

### Maximum Impact Guidelines
- **Clarity over complexity**: Be descriptive but focused
- **Specificity drives quality**: Generic prompts yield generic results
- **Iteration is key**: Refine prompts based on output quality

---

## Prompt Structure Framework

### Basic Template
```
[Camera/Lens] [Subject] in [Context], [Style], [Quality Modifiers], [Additional Details]
```

### Progressive Complexity Levels

**Level 1 - Essential**
```
[Subject] in [basic context], [basic style]
```
*Example: "Woman in coffee shop, portrait photography"*

**Level 2 - Enhanced**
```
[Camera type] [Subject] in [detailed context], [specific style], [quality modifier]
```
*Example: "35mm portrait of woman in vintage coffee shop, film noir style, high-quality"*

**Level 3 - Professional**
```
[Technical specs] [detailed subject] in [rich context], [artistic style], [multiple quality modifiers], [lighting], [mood]
```
*Example: "85mm lens portrait of professional woman in 1940s coffee shop interior, film noir cinematography, 4K resolution, dramatic lighting, moody atmosphere"*

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Layering Strategy
Build prompts in layers of increasing specificity:
1. **Foundation**: Subject + basic context
2. **Enhancement**: Add style and quality
3. **Refinement**: Include technical specifications
4. **Polishing**: Add atmospheric and mood elements

### Negative Space Utilization
- **Breathing Room**: "Surrounded by empty space for text overlay"
- **Focus Enhancement**: "Isolated subject against clean background"
- **Compositional Balance**: "Asymmetrical subject placement with negative space balance"

### Multi-Element Coordination
- **Foreground/Background**: "Sharp foreground subject with blurred background"
- **Color Harmony**: "Complementary color scheme throughout composition"
- **Thematic Consistency**: "All elements support central theme"

### Cultural and Context Sensitivity
- **Authentic Representation**: Research cultural elements for accuracy
- **Appropriate Context**: Ensure setting matches subject appropriately
- **Respectful Portrayal**: Avoid stereotypes or inappropriate cultural mixing

### Iteration and Refinement Process
1. **Start Simple**: Basic subject, context, style
2. **Test and Evaluate**: Generate initial images
3. **Identify Gaps**: What's missing or unclear?
4. **Add Specificity**: Enhance weak areas
5. **Refine Balance**: Ensure all elements work together
6. **Final Polish**: Add quality and professional modifiers
